# Authentication & Security Implementation

This document outlines the authentication and security improvements implemented in the Product Sales and Inventory Management System.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed User Registration & Store Assignment
- When a new user signs up, they are now automatically added to the `store_users` table
- The system now creates a new store if a store name is provided during registration
- The user's profile is linked to their store via the `store_id` field

### 2. Enhanced Privacy with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Implemented strict RLS policies to ensure users can only access their own data
- Users can only view and manage stores they are assigned to
- Data isolation ensures complete privacy between different users/stores
- All sensitive tables are protected with proper RLS policies

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added a global AuthErrorModal component to display authentication errors
- User-friendly error messages for common authentication issues
- Consistent error handling across login and registration pages
- Clear feedback when authentication operations fail

## Implementation Details

### 1. User Registration Flow
```
User submits registration form
↓
AuthContext.signUp() processes the request
↓
User is created in Supabase Auth
↓
Profile is created in 'profiles' table
↓
Store is created in 'stores' table (if store name provided)
↓
User is added to 'store_users' table with appropriate role
↓
User receives success confirmation
```

### 2. Row-Level Security Implementation
- All database tables have RLS enabled
- Policies are based on the `store_users` relationship
- Users can only see data from stores they belong to
- Role-based restrictions (owner/manager/staff) for write operations

### 3. Error Handling System
- Global AuthErrorContext provides error state management
- AuthErrorModal component displays errors in a modal popup
- User-friendly messages replace technical error descriptions
- Consistent error UI across the application

## SQL Migrations

Two SQL files have been created to implement these changes:

1. `enhanced-security-policies.sql` - Contains the RLS policies for all tables
2. `user-store-creation-trigger.sql` - Contains the database trigger for user registration

## How to Test

### Testing User Registration
1. Register a new user with a store name
2. Verify the user appears in the `auth.users` table
3. Verify a profile was created in the `profiles` table
4. Verify a store was created in the `stores` table
5. Verify the user was added to the `store_users` table

### Testing Data Privacy
1. Create two users with different stores
2. Login as one user and create some products
3. Login as the other user and verify they cannot see the first user's products
4. Attempt to access other users' data through API calls (should be blocked)

### Testing Error Handling
1. Try to login with incorrect credentials
2. Try to register with an email that already exists
3. Try to access a protected resource without authentication
4. Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the implementation:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the Supabase configuration in `supabase.js`
3. Check if RLS policies are correctly applied in the Supabase dashboard
4. Verify the database triggers are working correctly

## Security Considerations

- All data access is protected by RLS policies
- Authentication state is managed securely
- Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- Database operations use proper parameterization to prevent SQL injection

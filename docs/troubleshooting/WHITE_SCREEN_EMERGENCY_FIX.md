# üö® WHITE SCREEN EMERGENCY DIAGNOSIS

## Current Status
You're experiencing a **persistent white screen** even with minimal React components. This indicates a fundamental issue with:
- Environment configuration
- Service Worker interference
- Browser cache issues
- React/Vite setup

## üî• IMMEDIATE STEPS (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Hard Browser Refresh
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```
This clears all cached resources.

### Step 2: Clear All Browser Data (Critical)
1. Open **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Right-click** on the refresh button
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**
4. Or go to **Application > Storage > Clear Storage > Clear site data**

### Step 3: Disable Service Worker
1. In DevTools, go to **Application > Service Workers**
2. **Unregister** any existing service workers
3. Check **"Update on reload"**

### Step 4: Check Console Errors
1. Open **Developer Tools > Console**
2. Look for any **red errors**
3. Take a screenshot and share them

### Step 5: Try Emergency Test Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/emergency-test.html`

This bypasses all your app code and tests basic React functionality.

## üîç Quick Diagnostics

### Check These URLs:
1. `http://localhost:3000` - Main app (currently white screen)
2. `http://localhost:3000/emergency-test.html` - Emergency test (should be YELLOW)
3. `http://localhost:3000/src/main-minimal.jsx` - Should show the minimal JS file

### What Each Result Means:

**Yellow emergency page works**: React is fine, issue is with your app setup
**Emergency page also white**: Fundamental Vite/React configuration issue
**Can't access any page**: Server/network issue

## üõ†Ô∏è Files I've Modified

1. **index.html**: Disabled service worker, switched to minimal main.jsx
2. **main-minimal.jsx**: Ultra-basic React app with no dependencies
3. **emergency-test.html**: Pure HTML+React test page

## üö® Most Likely Causes

1. **Service Worker Cache**: Old SW blocking new code
2. **Browser Cache**: Cached broken resources
3. **Environment Variables**: Not loading properly
4. **CSS Issues**: Styling making content invisible
5. **React Context Errors**: Auth/Cart contexts failing silently

## üìã Recovery Plan

### If Emergency Test Works:
1. Gradually add back components
2. Fix environment variable loading
3. Re-enable service worker last

### If Emergency Test Fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try different browser
3. Restart Vite dev server
4. Check firewall/antivirus blocking

## üéØ Next Actions

1. **Try the emergency test URL**
2. **Clear browser cache completely**  
3. **Check console for any errors**
4. **Report what you see**

The fact that even a minimal React component shows white screen suggests either:
- Browser caching issues
- Service worker interference
- JavaScript execution being blocked

**Try the emergency test page first** - if that shows yellow, we know React works and can fix the main app.
